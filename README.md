# Online Book Shopping Application

The project is a web application for online book shopping, built using ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server.

I have used C# for writing the logic and Bootstrap for styling of the website. 

The application contains core functionalities such as User Authentication, Book Categorization, Dynamic Cart Management and simulated payment gateway at the User Portal. 
It also contains an Admin panel with functionalities such as Add Book Categories, Add Books, Check User Info and Check Orders date wise.

The files in this repository gives an overview of how the application looks and how it works.
There are screenshots attached of the running application.

This repository is designed to provide general information about the project and serves as a point of contact and information hub.
The private repository contains the code for this project and it can be accessed by requesting the access by directly reaching out to me.
